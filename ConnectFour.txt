----- Connect Four - 2 Players Game -----

---------- GAME INSTRUCTIONS ----------


# Objective
The objective of Connect Four is to be the first player to connect four of your own discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.


# Game Setup
  - The game is played on a vertical grid with 6 rows and 7 columns.
  - Players take turns dropping their discs into one of the columns.
  - The discs will occupy the lowest available space in the chosen column.


# Players
  - There are two players in the game:
  - Player 1 uses the disc marked as 'X'.
  - Player 2 uses the disc marked as 'O'.


# How to Play
  - Starting the Game: Player 1 goes first.
  - Taking Turns: Players alternate turns, choosing a column (0-6) to drop their disc.
  - Dropping a Disc: When a player chooses a column, the disc will fall to the lowest available row in that column.
  - Winning the Game: After each turn, the game checks for a win condition:
  - Horizontal Win: Four discs in a row horizontally.
  - Vertical Win: Four discs in a row vertically.
  - Diagonal Win: Four discs in a row diagonally (both directions).
  - Ending the Game: The game ends when one player connects four discs in a row. The winning player is announced.


# Rules
  - Players must choose a valid column (0-6). If a column is full, the player must choose another column.
  - The game continues until a player wins or all spaces are filled (resulting in a draw).
  - If the board is full and no player has connected four discs, the game is a draw.


# Tips for Winning
Try to create multiple opportunities to connect four discs while blocking your opponent from doing the same.
Pay attention to your opponent's moves and anticipate their strategy.
Use diagonal connections to surprise your opponent.
